                    <p class="database_article_text">During a pep rally at his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">school</a>, Andrew was sitting on the bleachers looking up at the sky feeling bored, when he suddenly saw his unrequited love, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Amy</a>, run onto the field. His admiration quickly turned into despair, however, as he witnessed her leap into the arms of her <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">boyfriend</a>, the captain of the school's football team, serving as a harsh reminder of the unfortunate news that Andrew already knew - that Amy had a boyfriend. Just then, his best friend, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Matt</a>, came by and apologized for being late. Noticing that Andrew was still upset, he reminded his friend that they had plans to go out to lunch, since pep rallies always meant half-days at school.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    Now at a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">restaurant</a>, Andrew and Matt overheard Amy scream. It just so happened that Amy was also as the restaurant with two of her friends, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Claire</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Elizabeth</a>, and the scream was an exaggerated sigh of annoyance, as a sudden lightning storm had caused her boyfriend's football game to be cancelled. At that moment, Andrew fell back into a depressed state. Matt tried to encourage his friend to finally say something to Amy, but their one sided conversation was cut short by a mysterious cloaked <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">figure</a> that barged into the establishment demanding to the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">hostess</a> for food or else everyone there would die. With the poor girl frozen in fear, the horned menace intended to stay true to his words as he prepared to strike her down, but a crying Amy suddenly shouted for the monster to stop. With the events feeling eerily similar to a recent nightmare she experienced where many people died in front of her, Amy declared that she did not want to watch anyone die, surprising and confusing everyone. Claiming she was brave, the figure decided to grant her an explanation on why he was there before killing her, stating that a pair of heroes named <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Cyborg X</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Shinobi</a> have recently appeared bringing with them a surge of hope and a longing for justice and that he wanted to remind the masses that malevolence was still as mighty as ever. This seemed to be news to Andrew, as he had not heard of these two heroes, leaving Matt in disbelief of his friend's ignorance. The cyborg then extended one of his mechanical limbs over to Amy in an attempt to claim his new target as his first victim. Seeing Amy in danger, Andrew jumped up and tried attacking the monster, only for his punch to do no damage whatsoever. The creature instead brought Amy back towards him with his retractable arm and threw her into Andrew, sending the two flying into tables with a force that would surely leave anyone heavily injured. Miraculously, the strange <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">pendant</a> that was hanging around the being's neck had touched Andrew's hand during his desperate attack and had seemingly appeared around Andrew's neck instead.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    Finding himself in a strange void of darkness, Andrew wondered if he was dead. Another mysterious <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">figure</a> introduced himself as a spirit sealed within the Talisman, the strange pendant now around Andrew's neck. Explaining that they were essentially in Andrew's mind where time moved slower, the spirit continued to state that he did not remember who he was or where he came from, but he did remember <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">someone</a> connecting with him at one point in the past as well as someone recently tapping into his power, the latter someone being the mysterious monster. He then informed Andrew that there were in fact two spirits sealed within the Talisman and that he was a spirit capable of manipulating the element of darkness. He added that the type of seal on the Talisman is one that reacts to emotions, but only for specific individuals, meaning that Andrew must have been under great distress to reach the spirit through the seal as well as being a special person. The spirit also went on to explain that the method to reach through the seal and to the spirit sealed within varies for each of the two spirits and that to reach him Andrew was actually more worried about himself than Amy at that moment when he touched the Talisman. Even though time moved slower for them, they still did not have much time, and so the spirit explained that Andrew now had enough power to stand up to the menace.

                    As the dust cleared from the area where Andrew and Amy were thrown, Andrew stood holding Amy, the two of them unharmed. Andrew claimed that he wanted to give that punch another shot. Noticing that Andrew now had his Talisman, the monster took the same hostess from before as a hostage, telling Andrew to give him the Talisman and in return he would spare everyone. Instead, Andrew distracted the beast by quickly throwing a knife, which caught the creature off guard long enough for Andrew to jump in close for a second attempt at a punch. With his fist hitting the metallic gut of the cyborg, the horned menace flew through multiple booths before crashing through the wall and landing outside unconscious. Their victory was cut short as, even though the storm had passed, lightning struck the ground near the unconscious monster, revealing another cloaked <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">creature</a>. With some newfound confidence, Andrew approached this new figure, who noticed that he was wearing the Talisman that was around the other monster's neck, revealing that the two creatures were in fact allies. Before she could attempt to take it back, the unconscious monster woke up and ordered for her to stop, as he wanted to get revenge; however, while powering up a strange cloak of darkness around himself, he ultimately decided to stop as he, unbeknownst to the others, noticed the duo, Cyborg X and Shinobi, on the roof of the restaurant. The two monsters fled the scene in a bolt of lightning, but not before the injured one threatened to eventually reclaim the Talisman and kill Andrew.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    Eventually, police showed up to the scene as well as a news crew, who reported on the events. With the Talisman continually reappearing around Andrew's neck, it was unable to be separated from Andrew and taken in as evidence and secured. The paramilitary organization, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">PALADUS</a>, stepped in and assigned two agents, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Leo Redfeld</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Clara Valentino</a>, to act as bodyguards who would watch over and protect Andrew as well as the Talisman.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    That night, after returning <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">home</a> with the two agents at his side, Andrew sat alone in his room and tried to once again reach out to the spirit inside the Talisman, calling him "Dark-Element-Spirit-of-Shadows-Guy", to which the spirit replied that "Dark Spirit" would suffice. After thanking the spirit for his help, the two decided it would be best if Andrew learned how to use the Dark Spirit's powers. After learning how to manipulate gravity, Andrew jumped for joy, resulting in a curious Leo inviting himself into Andrew's room and asking if everything was alright and who he was talking to, much to Andrew's annoyance.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    The weekend passed and Andrew found that with Leo and Clara standing guard around him at all times, everyone was too scared to be anywhere near him despite his heroic actions a few days earlier. Even Matt was questioned when he tried to approach Andrew, but an annoyed Andrew claimed that Matt was with him and for them to stand down. Matt tried to cheer Andrew up by telling him to think of the situation as him having his own personal bodyguards on top of the good news of him saving everyone three days ago, including Amy.

                    After school, Andrew and Matt were walking home with Leo and Clara behind them. All of a sudden, Cyborg X and Shinobi appeared claiming that they were there to test Andrew. Before Leo and Clara could interfere, Shinobi created a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">barrier</a> separating himself, Cyborg X, Leo, and Clara from Andrew and Matt, prompting Leo to call for backup. Shinobi then jumped over the barrier and launched a strange <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">energy attack</a> from one of the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">two blades</a> that he grabbed from his back. While Cyborg X prevented Leo and Clara from any attempts to get to Andrew, Shinobi launched another attack at Andrew, to which Andrew reacted by using his gravity powers to push himself off the floor, push Matt out of the way, and deflect the attack, claiming that he would pass Shinobi's test with flying colors</p>

He is also very naive at times, whether it's lacking knowledge of current events or misprouncing foreign names, but this only proves as a testament of his innocence and not of his lack of intelligence. He would rather be playing video games than training, but he thinks that being a hero does sound like it could be fun.</p>
